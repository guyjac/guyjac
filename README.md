## Hi, 👋 I'm Guy

I'm an aspiring software engineer who is always looking for smart ways to make work easier.

I recently graduated from the University of Essex with a degree in Computer Science (Networks). I have experience working with Python, Java, C#, PowerShell and R. I am also confident working with LAN and WAN technologies.

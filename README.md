## Hello World

I'm a software engineer currently working at Trimble Inc.

I am currently developing API services for a cloud platform utilising REST principles. My tech stack includes the usage of Java, Spring Boot, OpenApi and Mongo, following Microservice and Event driven architecture.
Other technologies employed in my role include Azure Devops, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes. I have also previously worked with the UI team, using React. 

In my spare time, I am studying Italian as a second language.
